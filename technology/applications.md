### Implementation Notes

Thoughts around how to match certain existing tool's features with a sophisticated Issue tracker (like Github/Gitlab Issues augmented by some form of Kanban)

 - Open Project
     + Backlogs -> Could be implemented with Milestones which will also allow to display as groups on Github/Gitlab as well as Swimlanes in Leanlab's Kanban 

 - Asana
     + Keyboard shortcuts and quick entry
     + 
 - Sprintly
     + User story templates
 - [Workfront](https://www.workfront.com/enterprise/features/)
     + Portfolio management
     + Mixed method (agile/waterfall)
 - Taiga
 - Trello
 - Blossom
 -
