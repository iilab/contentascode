## Components

Are actual software tools, formats, protocols that can be added/supported by particular implementations of content as code. Such as Github. Gitlab, Prose, Markdown, Jekyll, Metalsmith... Each component might server a purpose for a stage (or several) and is generally within a particular stack.
