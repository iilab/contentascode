## Strategies

The below roadmap is only loosely enforced and what drives progress on Content as Code is engagement from projects which are implementing such approaches and will help:
 - Develop building blocks with other development stacks
 - Extend features of existing building blocks (such as docsmith)
 - Participate in the user experience and technology design
